# Recommender-Systems
A recommender system that tries to resolve the limitations of collaborative filtering and content based filtering systems using a hybrid approach
This project is divided into the following stages.

•	Data Preprocessing and cleaning

•	Feature Selection and Engineering 

•	Building the Content Based Model

•	Testing the Content Based Model

•	Building the Collaborative Model

•	Testing the Collaborative Model

•	Building the Hybrid Model

•	Testing the Hybrid Model

The project uses the following python libraries.

•	Pandas

•	Numpy

•	Matplotlib

•	Seaborn

•	Sklearn

•	Scipy

The project is made up of a code.ipynb file that show the steps to import, preprocess and engineer the required features for building the recommendation models. It also includes visualization of the results when compared to a standard metrics.
The dataset used in modeling the recommender models are:

•	Movies.csv

•	Tags.csv 

•	Ratings.csv
